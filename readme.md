### Desiging phase
Well whenever I have to start working on any project, the first thing I do is start with design. 
Once you have the idea in your mind start desiging the UI for it and also I consider designing UX as well.
All though I'm not a professional UI/UX Desiginer but still I start with desiging. And also this is not a paid project so I cannot outsource designing and I kind of like desigining UI as well.
