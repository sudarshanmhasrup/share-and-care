### Designing phase
Well whenever I have to start working on any project, the first thing I do is start with design. 
Once you have the idea in your mind start designing the UI for it, and also I consider designing UX as well.
Although I'm not a professional UI/UX Designer but still I start with designing. And also this is not a paid project, 
so I cannot outsource designing and I kind of like designing UI as well.

#### Consumer App Login flow design (Mobile OTP)

If you take a closer look at the prototype that I have designed, you may notice that there is a `checkmark` which asks 
the user if he/she wants to receive OTP on `WhatsApp`. I want to promote `WhatsApp-based OTP` requests because it's a 
secure way to authenticate.

Also, I have made a minor change in UI design that improves user experience, which is adding a back button down below.
